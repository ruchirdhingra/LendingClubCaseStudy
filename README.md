## Conclusions
- People who default usually have higher amount of loans in comparison to the one's who pays off
- People having higher rate of interest tend to default on loan ie, on average more than 11-12%
- People having higher annual income tend to fully pay the loan
- People having 60 months as loan payment tenure tend to default more
- Loans of Grade E, F & G tend to get much more defaulted, specially sub grade F5, G3, G5
- Loans given for the purpose of Small Business, Renewable Energy & Education have higher rate of getting defaulted, whereas, loan given for Weddings has highest chances of being fully paid
- People opting for 60 months loan tend to default specially if they took it for Small Business or Educational purpose.
- Applicants who have verified incomes tend to default more, which is quite surprising and one of the reason of same could be that verified income applicants are easily given bigger loans and also at higher interest rate which tends them to default loan
- If Interest Rate of Loan is high, people tend to default on loans irrelevant of any other factor
People having lower income and opted for 60 months tenure tend much more to default loan
